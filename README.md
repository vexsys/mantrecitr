# mantrecitr
A program to help you &amp; your computer attain merit.
Whether you have trouble keeping track of how many mantra recitations you've done, or you can't focus long enough to do them, Mantrecitr is here for you.
It prompts you to type in the mantra you want to recite, the number of recitations, and the delay between recitations. If you want a manageably human speed, .5 or so is ideal. Otherwise, you can choose 0 and see how quickly your computer achieves enlightenment.
